; This model uses an event-based approach. It calculates how many events
; of each type should occur each tick and then executes those events in a random order.
; Event type could be signified by any constant. Here, we use the numbers 0, 1, and 2 to signify
; event types, but then store those numbers in variables with clear names for readability.

to go
  let swap-event 0
  let reproduce-event 1
  let select-event 2

  ; Note that we have to compute the number of global events rather than the
  ; number of actions that each individual patch performs since the execution of those
  ; events has to be random between the patches. That is, a single patch canâ€™t perform
  ; all of their actions in one go: suppose they end up executing 5 swaps in one tick.
  ; The swaps would be shuffling things around locally rather than allowing for an organism
  ; to travel multiple steps.

  ; Hence, this code creates a list with an entry for each event type that
  ; should occur this tick, then shuffles that list so that the events are in a random order.
  ; We then iterate through the list, and random neighboring patches run the corresponding event.
  
  let repetitions count patches / 3 ; At default settings, there will be an average of 1 event per patch.
