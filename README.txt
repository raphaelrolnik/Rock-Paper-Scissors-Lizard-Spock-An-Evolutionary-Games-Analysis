Overview
This project is an exploration of the evolutionary dynamics in the well-known game Rock Paper Scissors (RPS), extended to Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (RPSLS). The project utilizes NetLogo to simulate these interactions within a spatial environment, observing how different strategies and rules influence the game's equilibrium, cyclic behavior, and stable strategy evolution.

How to Run
Setup : Initialize the simulation environment by pressing the SETUP button in the NetLogo interface. This will distribute the initial population of agents randomly across the environment.

Go : Press the GO button to start the simulation. The agents will begin interacting based on the rules defined in the RPSLS or cannibalism models.

Parameters : Adjust the parameters like SWAP-RATE-EXPONENT, REPRODUCE-RATE-EXPONENT, and SELECT-RATE-EXPONENT to control the frequency of different events during each tick.
